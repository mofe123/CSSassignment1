        <p><strong><em> I love technology because it is inventive, ever-changing, and demanding.
            I believe that one thing that motivates me to work hard in my studies is my excitement
             about how much I can use technology to address problems in the world.
            With technology, there is never a dull moment because it never stops. As you solve one problem, 
            you see another that technology can solve and you can't wait to get started on it, solve it, 
            and be proud of your accomplishments.</em></strong></p>
